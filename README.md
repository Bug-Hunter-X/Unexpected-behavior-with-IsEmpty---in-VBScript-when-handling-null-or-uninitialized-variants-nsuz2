This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty()` function.  The `IsEmpty()` function in VBScript doesn't always reliably identify truly empty or null values, especially when dealing with Variant data types that might not be explicitly initialized.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in your script. The example shows how incorrect handling can manifest and how to implement a more robust solution.
